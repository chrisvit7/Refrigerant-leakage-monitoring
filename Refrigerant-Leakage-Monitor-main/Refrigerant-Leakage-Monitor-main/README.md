# Refrigerant-Leakage-Monitor

• Developed an IoT-based system to detect AC refrigerant leakages using sensors. 

• Aimed to enhance safety for households and industries by preventing hazardous 
incidents.

Components Required:

1.Arduino Uno 

2.Gas Sensor 

3.Buzzer 

4.LCD (16x2) 

5.Power Supply 

6.Connecting Wires 

7.IR LED 

8.IR Reciever    

9.R-600a GAS(Iso butane)

The Arduino Uno is a popular microcontroller board. It acts as the central processing unit of the Refrigerant Leakage Monitoring System. The Arduino Uno is responsible for reading data from the gas sensor, processing this data, and making decisions based on predefined logic.

WORKING:

*Our motivation for developing a Refrigerant Gas Leakage Monitoring Project stems from a commitment to 
safety, environmental responsibility, and technological innovation. 

*By leveraging Arduino microcontroller technology, gas sensors, a buzzer, and an IR blaster, our project aims to provide a robust and intelligent solution 
to detect excess gas leakage in AC or refrigeration systems. 

*The integration of these components allows for real-time monitoring of refrigerant levels. When a leak is detected, the system triggers a buzzer for immediate 
audible alerts, ensuring rapid response. 

*Additionally, the IR blaster facilitates an automatic shutdown of the AC or refrigeration system, preventing further leakage and safeguarding both occupants and the environment.    

This project not only aligns with our dedication to cutting-edge technology but also addresses critical safety and environmental concerns, showcasing our commitment to creating efficient and responsible solutions in the realm of refrigeration systems.
