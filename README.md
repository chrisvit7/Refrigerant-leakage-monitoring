# Refrigerant-leakage-monitoring
Developed a real-time Refrigerant Leakage Monitor using gas and temperature sensors with Arduino to detect HVAC refrigerant leaks. Implemented Python scripts with NumPy and Matplotlib for data analysis, anomaly detection, and visualization. Enabled predictive alerts, preventive maintenance, and energy efficiency.
